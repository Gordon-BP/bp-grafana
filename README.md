# Botpress Grafana Integration

By Gordy from Hanakano

## What is it?

A Botpress integration that allows async sending events to a Loki server so that they can be visualized in pretty dashboards using Grafana

## Why?

Because the built-in Botpress analytics, while customizable, cannot do detailed things like:
* Break down metrics by channel
* Export dashboards as PDFs
* Send automated alerts
