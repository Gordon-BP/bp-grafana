# Grafana Cloud Integration

This integration lets you send metric events to [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/products/cloud/) for additional observability.

The integration does not add any metrics automatically; instead, you must manually add the "Send Metric" card throughout your bot to record events. An "event" can be anything, such as:
* Conversation Start
* User Message
* Automation Completion
* Workflow Completion

Or anything else you'd like to add!

**Metrics cannot contain whitespace!**
